workspace(local folder)       staging area(index)         history(commits)

git config --list

git rm filename
    delete file and stage it too

//difference of workspace and staging area
    git diff
    
//difference of staging area and working history
    git diff --staged

//show all commits
    git log
    
//show all logs for a specific file
    git log -- filename
    
//stage a file
    git add filename
    
//unstage a file
    git reset HEAD -- filename
    
//reset the local file to same as staging area
    git checkout -- filename
    

    

//restore file from a earlier commit
git reset HEAD -- filename
    reset file in staging area to same as lastest commit version of that file
    we can use "git checkout filename" to reset the working file version as well

    OR.....
    git reset commitID -- filename
    reset file in staging area to same as given commit id version
